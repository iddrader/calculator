# Calculator

The third project in the curriculum. It was made after I've learned about DOM manipulations, events and more basic JavaScript, which helped me to build this project.

The order of operations is determined by the order the operations were entered. So multipication doesn't have priority over addition if the addition was entered first. I think it works fine for this type of calculator (i.e. just like mobile ones)
